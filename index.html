  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This is my very first website!</p>
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  Hi, I’m Jessica — a junior software developer with a background in digital marketing and design. After time spent working in a range of marketing roles, both salaried and freelance, I found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of software engineering as a career. I  realised that I loved the idea of being able to make things work behind the scenes just as much as making them look good on the surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was this curiosity that led me to pursue a career shift into software development, where I’m now completing a full-stack bootcamp. The transition has felt like the perfect fit — combining logic, creativity, and a love of continuous learning. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in front-end development, UI/UX, and accessibility. I enjoy building interfaces that are not just visually clean, but also functional and inclusive. I’m also curious about how software can be used to create tools that support neurodiverse users, simplify complex tasks, or improve people’s everyday lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    As someone who thrives on structure, detail, and creative expression, I bring a thoughtful and empathetic approach to everything I build.
